 - Changed `scanner_exists?` method to check `clamscan -V` for version instead of just `clamscan` which was causing a virus scan on the local folder. This ended up throwing false checks since I had a virus test file in the root of the directory.

 # v1.0.3
  - Added exceptions
  - New configuration options

```ruby
Clamby.configure({
   :check => false,
   :error_clamscan_missing => false,
   :error_file_missing => false,
   :error_file_virus => false
})

```
